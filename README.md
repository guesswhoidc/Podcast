## Backend

For the project to work propperly it's necessary to create a mysql database and set the settings on a .env file or set the environment variables before running.

The required variables to make the backend run are:

```sh
DB_NAME
DB_USERNAME
DB_PASSWORD
DB_HOST
```

To run the tests it's also necessary to have a database set up for it, you can set it up on tests.env.
